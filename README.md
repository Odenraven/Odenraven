# 👋 Hey, I'm Abd'Rashid (Odenraven)

I work with Meridian Technologies & Projects Ltd. as a digital systems and web engineer.  
Right now my focus is simple:

- building practical websites for small businesses,
- learning cybersecurity (offensive defender path), and
- experimenting with local AI/automation tools that run safely on my own machines.

## 🔧 What I actually do

- **Websites:** small business sites (landing pages, service pages, contact forms).
- **Systems:** Linux setups, basic servers, backups and simple monitoring.
- **Labs:** private cybersecurity lab work (Kali, DVWA, HackTheBox / TryHackMe).
- **Experiments:** local AI agents (Ollama + Python) to automate boring tasks.

I’m not here to show off perfect code. I’m using GitHub to track my progress and keep my projects in one place.

## 🛠️ Tools I'm using

- HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript  
- Python, Bash  
- Linux, Kali, Nmap, Burp Suite, DVWA  
- Flask (for simple dashboards and tools)

## 📌 Current Projects (in progress)

- **meridian-web-starter** – a basic template I use for small business sites.  
- **cyber-lab-notes** – notes, scripts and write-ups from my security lab.  
- **helm-experiments** – early experiments with local AI/agent automation.

More will appear here as I ship things.
